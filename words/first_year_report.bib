              description of common human genetic variation by applying
              whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of individuals from
              multiple populations. Here we report completion of the project,
              having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26
              populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome
              sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray
              genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic
              variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short
              insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants),
              all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes
              >99\% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1\% for a variety of
              ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation
              across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common
              disease studies.}

                 positional gene expression profiles derived from a gene
                 expression atlas. We show that this method allocates cells to
                 precise locations in the brain of the marine annelid
                 Platynereis dumerilii with a success rate of 81\%. Our method
                 is applicable to any system that has a reference gene

                 However, a mechanistic understanding of how these loci

  abstract =    {Using the Immunochip for genotyping, we identified 39
                 non-human leukocyte antigen (non-HLA) loci associated to
                 celiac disease (CeD), an immune-mediated disease with a
                 worldwide frequency of ∼1\%. The most significant non-HLA
                 signal mapped to the intronic region of 70 kb in the LPP gene.
                 Our aim was to fine map and identify possible functional
                 variants in the LPP locus. We performed a meta-analysis in a
                 cohort of 25 169 individuals from six different populations
                 previously genotyped using Immunochip. Imputation using data
                 from the Genome of the Netherlands and 1000 Genomes projects,
                 followed by meta-analysis, confirmed the strong association
                 signal on the LPP locus (rs2030519, P = 1.79 \texttimes{}
                 10(-49)), without any novel associations. The conditional
                 analysis on this top SNP-indicated association to a single
                 common haplotype. By performing haplotype analyses in each
                 population separately, as well as in a combined group of the
                 four populations that reach the significant threshold after
                 correction (P < 0.008), we narrowed down the CeD-associated
                 region from 70 to 2.8 kb (P = 1.35 \texttimes{} 10(-44)). By
                 intersecting regulatory data from the ENCODE project, we found
                 a functional SNP, rs4686484 (P = 3.12 \texttimes{} 10(-49)),
                 that maps to several B-cell enhancer elements and a highly
                 conserved region. This SNP was also predicted to change the
                 binding motif of the transcription factors IRF4, IRF11, Nkx2.7
                 and Nkx2.9, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation.
                 We later found significantly low levels of LPP mRNA in CeD
                 biopsies compared with controls, thus our results suggest that
                 rs4686484 is the functional variant in this locus, while LPP
                 expression is decreased in CeD.},

  abstract =    {SUMMARY: Circos plots are graphical outputs that display three
                 dimensional chromosomal interactions and fusion transcripts.
                 However, the Circos plot tool is not an interactive
                 visualization tool, but rather a figure generator. For
                 example, it does not enable data to be added dynamically nor
                 does it provide information for specific data points
                 interactively. Recently, an R-based Circos tool (RCircos) has
                 been developed to integrate Circos to R, but similarly,
                 Rcircos can only be used to generate plots. Thus, we have
                 developed a Circos plot tool (J-Circos) that is an interactive
                 visualization tool that can plot Circos figures, as well as
                 being able to dynamically add data to the figure, and
                 providing information for specific data points using mouse
                 hover display and zoom in/out functions. J-Circos uses the
                 Java computer language to enable, it to be used on most
                 operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Users can input
                 data into J-Circos using flat data formats, as well as from
                 the Graphical user interface (GUI). J-Circos will enable
                 biologists to better study more complex chromosomal
                 interactions and fusion transcripts that are otherwise
                 difficult to visualize from next-generation sequencing data.

                 activation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes.
                 Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is
                 crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and
                 homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples,
                 covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to
                 produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We
                 show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger
                 RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive,
                 relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is
                 strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to
                 compare regulatory programs between different cells at
                 unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory
                 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify
                 cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further
                 explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains
                 gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The
                 online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for

                 enhancers are considered separate classes of regulatory
                 elements, often distinguished by histone modifications.
                 However, recent studies have revealed broad similarities
                 between enhancers and promoters, blurring the distinction:
                 active enhancers often initiate transcription, and some gene
                 promoters have the potential to enhance transcriptional output
                 of other promoters. Here, we propose a model in which

                 functional element, with a unified architecture for

                 chromatin interactions in the mammalian nucleus. This method
                 is based on Chromosome Conformation Capture, in which
                 chromatin is crosslinked with formaldehyde, then digested, and
                 re-ligated in such a way that only DNA fragments that are
                 covalently linked together form ligation products. The
                 ligation products contain the information of not only where
                 they originated from in the genomic sequence but also where
                 they reside, physically, in the 3D organization of the genome.
                 In Hi-C, a biotin-labeled nucleotide is incorporated at the
                 ligation junction, enabling selective purification of chimeric
                 DNA ligation junctions followed by deep sequencing. The
                 compatibility of Hi-C with next generation sequencing
                 platforms makes it possible to detect chromatin interactions
                 on an unprecedented scale. This advance gives Hi-C the power
                 to both explore the biophysical properties of chromatin as
                 well as the implications of chromatin structure for the
                 biological functions of the nucleus. A massively parallel
                 survey of chromatin interaction provides the previously
                 missing dimension of spatial context to other genomic studies.
                 This spatial context will provide a new perspective to studies
                 of chromatin and its role in genome regulation in normal
                 conditions and in disease.},

                 association studies (GWAS) had modest sample sizes, reducing

                 GWAS, a meta-analysis with a published GWAS and a replication

                 new associations. Assisted by dense genome coverage,
                 imputation provided evidence for missense variants

                 genetic and environmental factors are known to regulate the
                 development of obesity and associated metabolic diseases,
                 emerging studies indicate that innate and adaptive immune cell
                 responses in adipose tissue have critical roles in the
                 regulation of metabolic homeostasis. In the lean state, type 2
                 cytokine-associated immune cell responses predominate in white
                 adipose tissue and protect against weight gain and insulin
                 resistance through direct effects on adipocytes and
                 elicitation of beige adipose. In obesity, these metabolically
                 beneficial immune pathways become dysregulated, and adipocytes
                 and other factors initiate metabolically deleterious type 1
                 inflammation that impairs glucose metabolism. This review
                 discusses our current understanding of the functions of
                 different types of adipose tissue and how immune cells

                 identified many loci implicated in disease susceptibility.
                 Integration of GWAS summary statistics (P-values) and
                 functional genomic datasets should help to elucidate
                 mechanisms. RESULTS: We extended a non-parametric SNP set
                 enrichment method to test for enrichment of GWAS signals in
                 functionally defined loci to a situation where only GWAS
                 P-values are available. The approach is implemented in VSEAMS,
                 a freely available software pipeline. We use VSEAMS to
                 identify enrichment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) GWAS associations
                 near genes that are targets for the transcription factors
                 IKZF3, BATF and ESRRA. IKZF3 lies in a known T1D
                 susceptibility region, while BATF and ESRRA overlap other
                 immune disease susceptibility regions, validating our approach
                 and suggesting novel avenues of research for T1D. AVAILABILITY

  abstract =    {Pathway analyses of genome-wide association studies aggregate
                 information over sets of related genes, such as genes in
                 common pathways, to identify gene sets that are enriched for
                 variants associated with disease. We develop a model-based
                 approach to pathway analysis, and apply this approach to data
                 from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC)
                 studies. Our method offers several benefits over existing
                 approaches. First, our method not only interrogates pathways
                 for enrichment of disease associations, but also estimates the
                 level of enrichment, which yields a coherent way to promote
                 variants in enriched pathways, enhancing discovery of genes
                 underlying disease. Second, our approach allows for multiple
                 enriched pathways, a feature that leads to novel findings in
                 two diseases where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
                 is a major determinant of disease susceptibility. Third, by
                 modeling disease as the combined effect of multiple markers,
                 our method automatically accounts for linkage disequilibrium
                 among variants. Interrogation of pathways from eight pathway
                 databases yields strong support for enriched pathways,
                 indicating links between Crohn's disease (CD) and
                 cytokine-driven networks that modulate immune responses;
                 between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ``Measles'' pathway
                 genes involved in immune responses triggered by measles
                 infection; and between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and IL2-mediated
                 signaling genes. Prioritizing variants in these enriched
                 pathways yields many additional putative disease associations
                 compared to analyses without enrichment. For CD and RA, 7 of 8
                 additional non-MHC associations are corroborated by other
                 studies, providing validation for our approach. For T1D,
                 prioritization of IL-2 signaling genes yields strong evidence
                 for 7 additional non-MHC candidate disease loci, as well as
                 suggestive evidence for several more. Of the 7 strongest
                 associations, 4 are validated by other studies, and 3 (near
                 IL-2 signaling genes RAF1, MAPK14, and FYN) constitute novel
                 putative T1D loci for further study.},

Here we report on the identification and characterization of a lncRNA, lnc13, that harbors a celiac disease-associated haplotype block and represses expression of certain inflammatory genes under homeostatic conditions. Lnc13 regulates gene expression by binding to hnRNPD, a member of a family of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Upon stimulation, lnc13 levels are reduced, thereby allowing increased expression of the repressed genes. Lnc13 levels are significantly decreased in small intestinal biopsy samples from patients with celiac disease, which suggests that down-regulation of lnc13 may contribute to the inflammation seen in this disease. Furthermore, the lnc13 disease-associated variant binds hnRNPD less efficiently than its wild-type counterpart, thus helping to explain how these single-nucleotide polymorphisms contribute to celiac disease.},

                 interactions, we identify 2 067 enhancers that interact with 1
                 619 promoters and enhance their expression. These enhancers
                 exist in accessible chromatin regions and are associated with
                 various histone modifications and polymerase II binding. The
                 promoters with interacting enhancers are expressed at higher

We validated our predictions with the use of directed perturbations in samples from patients and from mice and with endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in samples from patients.Our data indicate that the FTO allele associated with obesity represses mitochondrial thermogenesis in adipocyte precursor cells in a tissue-autonomous manner. The rs1421085 T-to-C single-nucleotide variant disrupts a conserved motif for the ARID5B repressor, which leads to derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer and a doubling of IRX3 and IRX5 expression during early adipocyte differentiation. This results in a cell-autonomous developmental shift from energy-dissipating beige (brite) adipocytes to energy-storing white adipocytes, with a reduction in mitochondrial thermogenesis by a factor of 5, as well as an increase in lipid storage. Inhibition of Irx3 in adipose tissue in mice reduced body weight and increased energy dissipation without a change in physical activity or appetite. Knockdown of IRX3 or IRX5 in primary adipocytes from participants with the risk allele restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7, and overexpression of these genes had the opposite effect in adipocytes from nonrisk-allele carriers. Repair of the ARID5B motif by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes from a patient with the risk allele restored IRX3 and IRX5 repression, activated browning expression programs, and restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7.Our results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis regulation involving ARID5B, rs1421085, IRX3, and IRX5, which, when manipulated, had pronounced pro-obesity and anti-obesity effects.

We examine more recent studies pertaining to the prevalence of 29 autoimmune diseases, and use these data to correct for the underascertainment of some diseases in the hospitalization registry data. This analysis results in an estimated prevalence of 7.6-9.4\%, depending on the size of the correction factor used. The rates for most diseases for which data are available from many geographic regions span overlapping ranges. We also review studies of the co-occurrence of diseases within individuals and within families, focusing on specific pairs of diseases to better distinguish patterns that may result in insights pertaining to shared etiological pathways. Overall, data support a tendency for autoimmune diseases to co-occur at greater than expected rates within proband patients and their families, but this does not appear to be a uniform phenomenon across all diseases. Multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis is one disease pair that appears to have a decreased chance of coexistence.},

  abstract = {The chromosome 16p13 region has been associated with several
              autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and multiple
              sclerosis (MS). CLEC16A has been reported as the most likely
              candidate gene in the region, since it contains the most
              disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as
              well as an imunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif.
              However, here we report that intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing the
              most autoimmune disease-associated SNPs, appears to behave as a
              regulatory sequence, affecting the expression of a neighbouring
              gene, DEXI. The CLEC16A alleles that are protective from T1D and
              MS are associated with increased expression of DEXI, and no other
              genes in the region, in two independent monocyte gene expression
              data sets. Critically, using chromosome conformation capture
              (3C), we identified physical proximity between the DEXI promoter
              region and intron 19 of CLEC16A, separated by a loop of >150 kb.
              In reciprocal experiments, a 20 kb fragment of intron 19 of
              CLEC16A, containing SNPs associated with T1D and MS, as well as
              with DEXI expression, interacted with the promotor region of DEXI
              but not with candidate DNA fragments containing other potential
              causal genes in the region, including CLEC16A. Intron 19 of
              CLEC16A is highly enriched for transcription-factor-binding
              events and markers associated with enhancer activity. Taken
              together, these data indicate that although the causal variants
              in the 16p13 region lie within CLEC16A, DEXI is an unappreciated
              autoimmune disease candidate gene, and illustrate the power of
              the 3C approach in progressing from genome-wide association
              studies results to candidate causal genes.}

                 meaningful way, gene and gene-set analysis constitute a
                 valuable addition to single-marker analysis. However, although
                 various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently
                 exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues.
                 Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by
                 linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker
                 associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on
                 permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis
                 computationally very expensive. To address these issues we
                 have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set
                 analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression
                 model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set
                 analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis
                 for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a
                 regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of
                 continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of
                 multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and
                 an analysis of Crohn's Disease data are used to evaluate the
                 performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other
                 gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA
                 has significantly more power than other tools for both the
                 gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and
                 gene sets associated with Crohn's Disease while maintaining a
                 correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the
                 Crohn's Disease data was found to be considerably faster as
                 well.},

Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we could confirm known qualitative features of chromosome organization within the nucleus and dynamic changes in that organization during meiosis. We also analyzed yeast chromosome III at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average 3D model of chromosome III could be determined.

  abstract =    {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 300 regions associated with more than 70 common diseases. However, identifying causal genes within an associated region remains a major challenge. One approach to resolving causal genes is through the dissection of gene-phenotype correlations. Here we use polychromatic flow cytometry to show that differences in surface expression of the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha (IL2RA, or CD25) protein are restricted to particular immune cell types and correlate with several haplotypes in the IL2RA region that have previously been associated with two autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and multiple sclerosis. We confirm our strongest gene-phenotype correlation at the RNA level by allele-specific expression (ASE). We also define key parameters for the design and implementation of post-GWAS gene-phenotype investigations and demonstrate the usefulness of a large bioresource of genotype-selectable normal donors from whom fresh, primary cells can be analyzed.},

                 disease-associated genes that can be candidate causal genes.
                 We propose a straightforward methodology that can be used for
                 conducting a gene-based pathway analysis using summary GWAS
                 statistics in combination with widely available reference
                 genotype data. We used this method to perform a gene-based
                 pathway analysis of a type 1 diabetes (T1D) meta-analysis GWAS
                 (of 7,514 cases and 9,045 controls). An important feature of
                 the conducted analysis is the removal of the major
                 histocompatibility complex gene region, the major genetic risk
                 factor for T1D. Thirty-one of the 1,583 (2\%) tested pathways
                 were identified to be enriched for association with T1D at a
                 5\% false discovery rate. We analyzed these 31 pathways and
                 their genes to identify SNPs in or near these pathway genes
                 that showed potentially novel association with T1D and
                 attempted to replicate the association of 22 SNPs in
                 additional samples. Replication P-values were skewed
                 (P=9.85\texttimes{}{}10-11) with 12 of the 22 SNPs showing
                 P<0.05. Support, including replication evidence, was obtained

Over the last two years we redeveloped major components of the Reactome web interface to improve usability, responsiveness and data visualization. A new pathway diagram viewer provides a faster, clearer interface and smooth zooming from the entire reaction network to the details of individual reactions. Tool performance for analysis of user datasets has been substantially improved, now generating detailed results for genome-wide expression datasets within seconds. The analysis module can now be accessed through a RESTFul interface, facilitating its inclusion in third party applications. A new overview module allows the visualization of analysis results on a genome-wide Reactome pathway hierarchy using a single screen page. The search interface now provides auto-completion as well as a faceted search to narrow result lists efficiently.},

Using paired purified primary monocytes and B cells, we identify new predominantly cell type-specific cis and trans expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), including multi-locus trans associations to LYZ and KLF4 in monocytes and B cells, respectively. Additionally, we observe a B cell-specific trans association of rs11171739 at 12q13.2, a known autoimmune disease locus, with IP6K2 (P = 5.8 × 10(-15)), PRIC285 (P = 3.0 × 10(-10)) and an upstream region of CDKN1A (P = 2 × 10(-52)), suggesting roles for cell cycle regulation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling in autoimmune pathogenesis. We also find that specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles form trans associations with the expression of AOAH and ARHGAP24 in monocytes but not in B cells. In summary, we show that mapping gene expression in defined primary cell populations identifies new cell type-specific trans-regulated networks and provides insights into the genetic basis of disease susceptibility.},

                 fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants
                 for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data. We integrated
                 these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory

Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements distant from gene promoters. Although distal binding sites have been shown to regulate transcription by long-range chromatin interactions at a few loci, chromatin interactions and their impact on transcription regulation have not been investigated in a genome-wide manner. Here we describe the development of a new strategy, chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) for the de novo detection of global chromatin interactions, with which we have comprehensively mapped the chromatin interaction network bound by oestrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) in the human genome. We found that most high-confidence remote ER-alpha-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters through long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-alpha functions by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation. We propose that chromatin interactions constitute a primary mechanism for regulating transcription in mammalian genomes.},

  abstract =    {We previously showed that disease-linked metabolic genes are
                 often under combinatorial regulation. Using the genome-wide
                 ChIP-Seq binding profiles for 93 transcription factors in nine
                 different cell lines, we show that genes under high regulatory
                 load are significantly enriched for disease-association across
                 cell types. We find that transcription factor load correlates
                 with the enhancer load of the genes and thereby allows the
                 identification of genes under high regulatory load by
                 epigenomic mapping of active enhancers. Identification of the
                 high enhancer load genes across 139 samples from 96 different
                 cell and tissue types reveals a consistent enrichment for
                 disease-associated genes in a cell type-selective manner. The
                 underlying genes are not limited to super-enhancer genes and
                 show several types of disease-association evidence beyond
                 genetic variation (such as biomarkers). Interestingly, the
                 high regulatory load genes are involved in more KEGG pathways

                 centrality in the interaction network of liver disease genes,
                 and carry longer 3' UTRs with more microRNA (miRNA) binding
                 sites than genes on average, suggesting a role as hubs
                 integrating signals within regulatory networks. In summary,
                 epigenetic mapping of active enhancers presents a promising

  abstract =    {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.},

                 putative novel regulators of megakaryopoiesis and platelet

                 gene silencing in Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster, we
                 identified 11 of the genes as novel regulators of blood cell

Although gene regulation often involves long-range interactions, it is unknown to what extent non-coding genetic variants influence distal molecular phenotypes. Here, we integrate chromatin profiling for three histone marks in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 75 sequenced individuals with LCL-specific Hi-C and ChIA-PET-based chromatin contact maps to uncover one of the largest collections of local and distal histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). Distal QTLs are enriched within topologically associated domains and exhibit largely concordant variation of chromatin state coordinated by proximal and distal non-coding genetic variants. Histone QTLs are enriched for common variants associated with autoimmune diseases and enable identification of putative target genes of disease-associated variants from genome-wide association studies. These analyses provide insights into how genetic variation can affect human disease phenotypes by coordinated changes in chromatin at interacting regulatory elements.},

                 identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are

                 investigated the genetic regulation of gene expression have
                 shown that disease-associated variants are over-represented
                 amongst expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants.
                 Evidence for colocalisation of eQTL and disease causal
                 variants can suggest causal genes and cells for these genetic
                 associations. Here we used colocalisation analysis to
                 investigate whether whether 595 genetic associations to ten
                 immune-mediated diseases are consistent with a causal variant
                 that regulates, in cis, gene expression in resting B cells,
                 and in resting and stimulated monocytes. Previously published
                 candidate causal genes were over-represented amongst genes

                 (GWASs) of complex disease, but their contributions to trait
                 heritability are currently unknown. We applied
                 variance-component methods to imputed genotype data for 11
                 common diseases to partition the heritability explained by
                 genotyped SNPs (hg(2)) across functional categories (while
                 accounting for shared variance due to linkage disequilibrium).
                 Extensive simulations showed that in contrast to current
                 estimates from GWAS summary statistics, the variance-component
                 approach partitions heritability accurately under a wide range
                 of complex-disease architectures. Across the 11 diseases
                 DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) from 217 cell types
                 spanned 16\% of imputed SNPs (and 24\% of genotyped SNPs) but
                 explained an average of 79\% (SE = 8\%) of hg(2) from imputed
                 SNPs (5.1\texttimes{} enrichment; p = 3.7 \texttimes{}
                 10(-17)) and 38\% (SE = 4\%) of hg(2) from genotyped SNPs
                 (1.6\texttimes{} enrichment, p = 1.0 \texttimes{} 10(-4)).
                 Further enrichment was observed at enhancer DHSs and
                 cell-type-specific DHSs. In contrast, coding variants, which
                 span 1\% of the genome, explained <10\% of hg(2) despite
                 having the highest enrichment. We replicated these findings
                 but found no significant contribution from rare coding
                 variants in independent schizophrenia cohorts genotyped on
                 GWAS and exome chips. Our results highlight the value of
                 analyzing components of heritability to unravel the functional

However, for almost all loci, understanding of the mechanisms leading to autoimmunity remains limited, and most variants that are likely to be causal are in non-coding regions of the genome. A critical next step will be to identify the in vivo and ex vivo immunophenotypes that are affected by risk variants. To do this, key cell types and cell states that are implicated in autoimmune diseases will need to be defined. Functional genomic annotations from these cell types and states can then be used to resolve candidate genes and causal variants. Together with longitudinal studies, this approach may yield pivotal insights into how autoimmunity is triggered.},

Here, we have compiled a comprehensive up-to-date list of the autoimmune diseases, and have reviewed published literature to estimate their prevalence. We identified 81 autoimmune diseases. The overall estimated prevalence is 4.5\%, with 2.7\% for males and 6.4\% for females. For specific diseases, prevalence ranges from 1\% to <1/10(6). Considering all diseases in the class, the most common mean age-of-onset was 40-50 years. This list of autoimmune diseases has also yielded information about autoantigens. Forty-five autoimmune diseases have been associated with well-defined autoantigens. Of the diseases with known autoantigens, 33.3\% had highly repetitive sequences, 35.6\% had coiled-coil arrangements and 57.8\% were associated with cellular membranes, which means that based on these structural motifs alone, autoantigens do not appear to be a random sample of the human proteome. Finally, we identified 19 autoimmune diseases that phenocopy diseases arising from germline mutations in the corresponding autoantigen. Collectively, our findings lead to a tentative proposal for criteria for assigning autoimmune pathogenesis to a particular disease.},

  abstract =    {MOTIVATION: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
                 have identified thousands of variants associated with common
                 diseases and complex traits, only a handful of these variants
                 are validated to be causal. We consider 'causal variants' as
                 variants which are responsible for the association signal at a
                 locus. As opposed to association studies that benefit from
                 linkage disequilibrium (LD), the main challenge in identifying
                 causal variants at associated loci lies in distinguishing
                 among the many closely correlated variants due to LD. This is
                 particularly important for model organisms such as inbred
                 mice, where LD extends much further than in human populations,
                 resulting in large stretches of the genome with significantly
                 associated variants. Furthermore, these model organisms are
                 highly structured and require correction for population
                 structure to remove potential spurious associations. RESULTS:
                 In this work, we propose CAVIAR-Gene (CAusal Variants
                 Identification in Associated Regions), a novel method that is
                 able to operate across large LD regions of the genome while
                 also correcting for population structure. A key feature of our
                 approach is that it provides as output a minimally sized set
                 of genes that captures the genes which harbor causal variants
                 with probability $\varrho$. Through extensive simulations, we
                 demonstrate that our method not only speeds up computation,
                 but also have an average of 10\% higher recall rate compared
                 with the existing approaches. We validate our method using a
                 real mouse high-density lipoprotein data (HDL) and show that
                 CAVIAR-Gene is able to identify Apoa2 (a gene known to harbor
                 causal variants for HDL), while reducing the number of genes
                 that need to be tested for functionality by a factor of 2.

  abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal
              inflammatory disorder that affects millions worldwide.
              Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 200
              IBD-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to
              specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94
              IBD loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. Of
              the 139 independent associations identified in these regions, 18
              were pinpointed to a single causal variant with >95\% certainty,
              and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with >50\%
              certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for
              protein-coding changes (n=13), direct disruption of transcription
              factor binding sites (n=3) and tissue specific epigenetic marks
              (n=10), with the latter category showing enrichment in specific
              immune cells among associations stronger in CD and gut mucosa
              among associations stronger in UC. The results of this study
              suggest that high-resolution, fine-mapping in large samples can
              convert many GWAS discoveries into statistically convincing
              causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental
              elucidation of disease mechanisms.},

Here we impute 1,380,133 indels based on the latest 1,000 Genomes Project panel into three eQTL data sets from multiple tissues. Imputation of indels increased 9.9\% power and identifies indel-specific eQTLs for 325 genes. We find introns and vicinities of UTRs are more enriched of indel eQTLs and 3.6 (single-tissue)-9.2\%(multi-tissue) of previous identified eSNPs were taggers of eindels. Functional analyses identifies epigenetics marks, gene ontology categories and disease GWAS loci affected by SNPs and indels eQTLs showing tissue-consistent or tissue-specific effects. This study provides new insights into the underlying genetic architecture of gene expression across tissues and new resource to interpret function of diseases and traits associated structure variants.},

  abstract = {Blood pressure is a heritable trait influenced by several
              biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over
              one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg
              systolic blood pressure or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure).
              Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an
              increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide
              association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which
              used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European
              descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain
              genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure
              (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2,
              GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure
              physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide
              significant variants was associated with hypertension, left
              ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease,
              but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed
              associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and
              African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights
              into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest
              potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease
              prevention.}

                 populations and includes 25-35\% of common SNP variation in
                 the populations surveyed. The map is estimated to capture
                 untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between
                 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the
                 current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping
                 products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum
                 r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African

                 reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage
                 disequilibrium. We show that 10-30\% of pairs of individuals
                 within a population share at least one region of extended
                 genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to
                 1\% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because
                 they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that
                 recombination rates vary systematically around genes and
                 between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate
                 increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to
                 synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis is a common disease of the central nervous
              system in which the interplay between inflammatory and
              neurodegenerative processes typically results in intermittent
              neurological disturbance followed by progressive accumulation of
              disability. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic
              factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased
              frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected
              individuals, and systematic attempts to identify linkage in
              multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major
              histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual
              effect on risk. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies
              (GWAS) have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be
              identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest
              individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility.
              Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the
              disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the
              analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently
              available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS
              involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23
              research groups working in 15 different countries, we have
              replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations
              and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci.
              Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk
              alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies
              the independent protective effect attributable to the class I
              region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly
              overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci
              and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the
              pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.}

                 identifying putatively causal variants for a disease or trait
                 among the abundant natural variation that occurs at a locus of
                 interest. The main challenges in using these various
                 annotations include their large numbers and their diversity.
                 Here we develop an unsupervised approach to integrate these
                 different annotations into one measure of functional
                 importance (Eigen) that, unlike most existing methods, is not

                 disease-associated and putatively benign variants from
                 published studies (in both coding and noncoding regions) than
                 the recently proposed CADD score. Across varied scenarios, the
                 Eigen score performs generally better than any single

Chromosome conformation capture implemented in Hi-C allows for genome-wide agnostic characterization of chromatin contacts. However, detection of functional enhancer-promoter interactions is precluded by its effective resolution that is determined by both restriction fragmentation and sensitivity of the experiment. Here we develop a capture Hi-C (cHi-C) approach to allow an agnostic characterization of these physical interactions on a genome-wide scale. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with complex diseases often reside within regulatory elements and exert effects through long-range regulation of gene expression. Applying this cHi-C approach to 14 colorectal cancer risk loci allows us to identify key long-range chromatin interactions in cis and trans involving these loci.},

                 meta-analysis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
                 genome-wide association scans, followed by extensive
                 validation of significant findings, with a combined total of
                 more than 75,000 cases and controls. We identify 71 new
                 associations, for a total of 163 IBD loci, that meet
                 genome-wide significance thresholds. Most loci contribute to
                 both phenotypes, and both directional (consistently favouring
                 one allele over the course of human history) and balancing
                 (favouring the retention of both alleles within populations)
                 selection effects are evident. Many IBD loci are also
                 implicated in other immune-mediated disorders, most notably
                 with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. We also observe
                 considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and
                 mycobacterial infection. Gene co-expression network analysis
                 emphasizes this relationship, with pathways shared between
                 host responses to mycobacteria and those predisposing to IBD.},

  abstract =    {Localization of causal variants underlying known risk loci is
                 one of the main research challenges following genome-wide
                 association studies. Risk loci are typically dissected through
                 fine-mapping experiments in trans-ethnic cohorts for
                 leveraging the variability in the local genetic structure
                 across populations. More recent works have shown that genomic
                 functional annotations (i.e., localization of tissue-specific
                 regulatory marks) can be integrated for increasing
                 fine-mapping performance within single-population studies.
                 Here, we introduce methods that integrate the strength of
                 association between genotype and phenotype, the variability in
                 the genetic backgrounds across populations, and the genomic
                 map of tissue-specific functional elements to increase
                 trans-ethnic fine-mapping accuracy. Through extensive
                 simulations and empirical data, we have demonstrated that our
                 approach increases fine-mapping resolution over existing
                 methods. We analyzed empirical data from a large-scale
                 trans-ethnic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) study and showed that
                 the functional genetic architecture of RA is consistent across
                 European and Asian ancestries. In these data, we used our
                 proposed methods to reduce the average size of the 90\%
                 credible set from 29 variants per locus for standard
                 non-integrative approaches to 22 variants.},

  abstract =    {Standard statistical approaches for prioritization of variants for functional testing in fine-mapping studies either use marginal association statistics or estimate posterior probabilities for variants to be causal under simplifying assumptions. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation. A key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus. We devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance. Using simulations starting from the 1000 Genomes data, we find that our framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods, reducing the number of variants that need to be selected to capture 90\% of the causal variants from an average of 13.3 to 10.4 SNPs per locus (as compared to the next-best performing strategy). Furthermore, we introduce a cost-to-benefit optimization framework for determining the number of variants to be followed up in functional assays and assess its performance using real and simulation data. We validate our findings using a large scale meta-analysis of four blood lipids traits and find that the relative probability for causality is increased for variants in exons and transcription start sites and decreased in repressed genomic regions at the risk loci of these traits. Using these highly predictive, trait-specific functional annotations, we estimate causality probabilities across all traits and variants, reducing the size of the 90\% confidence set from an average of 17.5 to 13.5 variants per locus in this data.},

                 high-frequency human-derived alleles from 14.7 million

                 is a powerful technique for studying the spatial interactions
                 of a specific genomic region called the ``viewpoint'' with the
                 rest of the genome, both in a single condition or comparing
                 different experimental conditions or cell types. Observed
                 ligation frequencies typically show a strong, regular
                 dependence on genomic distance from the viewpoint, on top of
                 which specific interaction peaks are superimposed. Here, we
                 address the computational task to find these specific peaks
                 and to detect changes between different biological conditions.
                 RESULTS: We model the overall trend of decreasing interaction
                 frequency with genomic distance by fitting a smooth
                 monotonically decreasing function to suitably transformed
                 count data. Based on the fit, z-scores are calculated from the
                 residuals, and high z-scores are interpreted as peaks
                 providing evidence for specific interactions. To compare
                 different conditions, we normalize fragment counts between
                 samples, and call for differential contact frequencies using
                 the statistical method DESeq2 adapted from RNA-Seq analysis.

                 whereas CpG methylation changed extensively during B cell
                 maturation, showing an accumulative pattern and affecting
                 around 30\% of all measured CpG sites. Early differentiation
                 stages mainly displayed enhancer demethylation, which was
                 associated with upregulation of key B cell transcription
                 factors and affected multiple genes involved in B cell
                 biology. Late differentiation stages, in contrast, showed

                 biological insight. Here, we present Pascal (Pathway scoring
                 algorithm), a powerful tool for computing gene and pathway
                 scores from SNP-phenotype association summary statistics. For
                 gene score computation, we implemented analytic and efficient
                 numerical solutions to calculate test statistics. We examined
                 in particular the sum and the maximum of chi-squared
                 statistics, which measure the strongest and the average
                 association signals per gene, respectively. For pathway
                 scoring, we use a modified Fisher method, which offers not
                 only significant power improvement over more traditional
                 enrichment strategies, but also eliminates the problem of
                 arbitrary threshold selection inherent in any binary
                 membership based pathway enrichment approach. We demonstrate
                 the marked increase in power by analyzing summary statistics
                 from dozens of large meta-studies for various traits. Our
                 extensive testing indicates that our method not only excels in
                 rigorous type I error control, but also results in more
                 biologically meaningful discoveries.},

                 widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most
                 genes, with transcript structure and expression level
                 variation being equally common but genetically largely

                 variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory
                 and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer
                 putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated

                 the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the

  abstract =    {Synonymous sites are generally assumed to be subject to weak selective constraint. For this reason, they are often neglected as a possible source of important functional variation. We use site frequency spectra from deep population sequencing data to show that, contrary to this expectation, 22\% of four-fold synonymous (4D) sites in Drosophila melanogaster evolve under very strong selective constraint while few, if any, appear to be under weak constraint. Linking polymorphism with divergence data, we further find that the fraction of synonymous sites exposed to strong purifying selection is higher for those positions that show slower evolution on the Drosophila phylogeny. The function underlying the inferred strong constraint appears to be separate from splicing enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and the translational optimization generating canonical codon bias. The fraction of synonymous sites under strong constraint within a gene correlates well with gene expression, particularly in the mid-late embryo, pupae, and adult developmental stages. Genes enriched in strongly constrained synonymous sites tend to be particularly functionally important and are often involved in key developmental pathways. Given that the observed widespread constraint acting on synonymous sites is likely not limited to Drosophila, the role of synonymous sites in genetic disease and adaptation should be reevaluated.},

                 causal risk variants within implicated genomic regions remains
                 a major challenge. Here we present a new sequence-based
                 computational method to predict the effect of regulatory
                 variation, using a classifier (gkm-SVM) that encodes cell
                 type-specific regulatory sequence vocabularies. The induced
                 change in the gkm-SVM score, deltaSVM, quantifies the effect
                 of variants. We show that deltaSVM accurately predicts the
                 impact of SNPs on DNase I sensitivity in their native genomic
                 contexts and accurately predicts the results of dense
                 mutagenesis of several enhancers in reporter assays.
                 Previously validated GWAS SNPs yield large deltaSVM scores,
                 and we predict new risk-conferring SNPs for several autoimmune
                 diseases. Thus, deltaSVM provides a powerful computational

In genome-wide association studies, single-marker meta-analysis has been widely used to increase statistical power by combining results via regression coefficients and standard errors from different studies. In analysis of rare variants in sequencing studies, region-based multimarker tests are often used to increase power. We propose meta-analysis methods for commonly used gene- or region-based rare variants tests, such as burden tests and variance component tests. Because estimation of regression coefficients of individual rare variants is often unstable or not feasible, the proposed method avoids this difficulty by calculating score statistics instead that only require fitting the null model for each study and then aggregating these score statistics across studies. Our proposed meta-analysis rare variant association tests are conducted based on study-specific summary statistics, specifically score statistics for each variant and between-variant covariance-type (linkage disequilibrium) relationship statistics for each gene or region. The proposed methods are able to incorporate different levels of heterogeneity of genetic effects across studies and are applicable to meta-analysis of multiple ancestry groups. We show that the proposed methods are essentially as powerful as joint analysis by directly pooling individual level genotype data. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our methods by varying levels of heterogeneity across studies, and we apply the proposed methods to meta-analysis of rare variant effects in a multicohort study of the genetics of blood lipid levels.},

                 set of responses and predictors is a fundamental statistical
                 task in integrative genomics, exemplified by numerous
                 expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies. Of
                 particular interest are so-called ``hotspots'', important
                 genetic variants that regulate the expression of many genes.
                 Recently, attention has focussed on whether eQTLs are common
                 to several tissues, cell-types or, more generally, conditions
                 or whether they are specific to a particular condition.
                 RESULTS: We have implemented MT-HESS, a Bayesain hierarchical
                 model that analyses the association between a large set of
                 predictors, e.g. SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), and
                 many responses, e.g. gene expression, in multiple tissues,
                 cells or conditions. Our Bayesian sparse regression algorithm
                 goes beyond ``one-at-a-time'' association tests between SNPs
                 and responses and uses a fully multivariate model search
                 across all linear combinations of SNPs, coupled with a model
                 of the correlation between condition/tissue-specific
                 responses. Additionally, we use a hierarchical structure to
                 leverage shared information across different genes, thus
                 improving the detection of hotspots. We show the increase of
                 power resulting from our new approach in an extensive
                 simulation study. Our analysis of two case studies highlights
                 new hotspots that would remain undetected by standard
                 approaches and shows how greater prediction power can be
                 achieved when several tissues are jointly considered.

  abstract =    {Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are polygenic diseases affecting
                 7-10\% of the population in the Western Hemisphere with few
                 effective therapies. Here, we quantify the heritability of
                 paediatric AIDs (pAIDs), including JIA, SLE, CEL, T1D, UC, CD,
                 PS, SPA and CVID, attributable to common genomic variations
                 (SNP-h(2)). SNP-h(2) estimates are most significant for T1D
                 (0.863±s.e. 0.07) and JIA (0.727±s.e. 0.037), more modest for
                 UC (0.386±s.e. 0.04) and CD (0.454±0.025), largely consistent
                 with population estimates and are generally greater than that
                 previously reported by adult GWAS. On pairwise analysis, we
                 observed that the diseases UC-CD (0.69±s.e. 0.07) and JIA-CVID
                 (0.343±s.e. 0.13) are the most strongly correlated. Variations
                 across the MHC strongly contribute to SNP-h(2) in T1D and JIA,
                 but does not significantly contribute to the pairwise rG.
                 Together, our results partition contributions of shared versus
                 disease-specific genomic variations to pAID heritability,
                 identifying pAIDs with unexpected risk sharing, while
                 recapitulating known associations between autoimmune diseases

  abstract =    {Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is the most
                 common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adults,
                 characterized by B-cell abnormalities and inadequate antibody
                 response. CVID patients have considerable autoimmune
                 comorbidity and we therefore hypothesized that genetic
                 susceptibility to CVID may overlap with autoimmune disorders.
                 Here, in the largest genetic study performed in CVID to date,
                 we compare 778 CVID cases with 10,999 controls across 123,127
                 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Immunochip. We
                 identify the first non-HLA genome-wide significant risk locus
                 at CLEC16A (rs17806056, P=2.0 \texttimes{} 10(-9)) and confirm
                 the previously reported human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
                 associations on chromosome 6p21 (rs1049225, P=4.8 \texttimes{}
                 10(-16)). Clec16a knockdown (KD) mice showed reduced number of
                 B cells and elevated IgM levels compared with controls,
                 suggesting that CLEC16A may be involved in immune regulatory
                 pathways of relevance to CVID. In conclusion, the CLEC16A
                 associations in CVID represent the first robust evidence of
                 non-HLA associations in this immunodeficiency condition.},

Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include >10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

  abstract =    {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach for uncovering disease-associated variants in human, but fine-mapping the causal variants remains a challenge. This is partly remedied by prioritization of disease-associated variants that overlap GWAS-enriched epigenomic annotations. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations. In simulation, RiVIERA promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95\% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites. Furthermore, joint modeling the nine immune traits by simultaneously inferring and exploiting the underlying epigenomic correlation between traits further improved the functional enrichments compared to single-trait models.},

  abstract =    {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in
                 identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated
                 with many traits and diseases. However, at existing sample
                 sizes, these variants explain only part of the estimated
                 heritability. Leverage of GWAS results from related phenotypes
                 may improve detection without the need for larger datasets.
                 The Bayesian conditional false discovery rate (cFDR)
                 constitutes an upper bound on the expected false discovery
                 rate (FDR) across a set of SNPs whose p values for two
                 diseases are both less than two disease-specific thresholds.
                 Calculation of the cFDR requires only summary statistics and
                 have several advantages over traditional GWAS analysis.
                 However, existing methods require distinct control samples
                 between studies. Here, we extend the technique to allow for
                 some or all controls to be shared, increasing applicability.
                 Several different SNP sets can be defined with the same cFDR
                 value, and we show that the expected FDR across the union of
                 these sets may exceed expected FDR in any single set. We
                 describe a procedure to establish an upper bound for the
                 expected FDR among the union of such sets of SNPs. We apply
                 our technique to pairwise analysis of p values from ten
                 autoimmune diseases with variable sharing of controls,
                 enabling discovery of 59 SNP-disease associations which do not
                 reach GWAS significance after genomic control in individual
                 datasets. Most of the SNPs we highlight have previously been
                 confirmed using replication studies or larger GWAS, a useful
                 validation of our technique; we report eight SNP-disease
                 associations across five diseases not previously declared. Our
                 technique extends and strengthens the previous algorithm, and
                 establishes robust limits on the expected FDR. This approach
                 can improve SNP detection in GWAS, and give insight into
                 shared aetiology between phenotypically related conditions.},

                 population heterogeneity. However, in many instances,
                 computational tools to analyze the wealth of data generated by
                 these technologies are lacking. Here, we present a
                 computational framework for unbiased combinatorial
                 polyfunctionality analysis of antigen-specific T-cell subsets
                 (COMPASS). COMPASS uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework to
                 model all observed cell subsets and select those most likely
                 to have antigen-specific responses. Cell-subset responses are
                 quantified by posterior probabilities, and human subject-level
                 responses are quantified by two summary statistics that
                 describe the quality of an individual's polyfunctional
                 response and can be correlated directly with clinical outcome.
                 Using three clinical data sets of cytokine production, we
                 demonstrate how COMPASS improves characterization of
                 antigen-specific T cells and reveals cellular 'correlates of
                 protection/immunity' in the RV144 HIV vaccine efficacy trial

  abstract =    {Researchers worldwide have generated a huge volume of genomic data, including thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and massive amounts of gene expression data from different tissues. How to perform a joint analysis of these data to gain new biological insights has become a critical step in understanding the etiology of complex diseases. Due to the polygenic architecture of complex diseases, the identification of risk genes remains challenging. Motivated by the shared risk genes found in complex diseases and tissue-specific gene expression patterns, we propose as an Empirical Bayes approach to integrating Pleiotropy and Tissue-Specific information (EPS) for prioritizing risk genes.As demonstrated by extensive simulation studies, EPS greatly improves the power of identification for disease-risk genes. EPS enables rigorous hypothesis testing of pleiotropy and tissue-specific risk gene expression patterns. All of the model parameters can be adaptively estimated from the developed expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We applied EPS to the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia GWAS from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, along with the gene expression data for multiple tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. The results of the real data analysis demonstrate many advantages of EPS.The EPS software is available on https://sites.google.com/site/liujin810822 CONTACT: eeyang@hkbu.edu.hkSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract =    {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been a
                 great success in the past decade. However, significant
                 challenges still remain in both identifying new risk loci and
                 interpreting results. Bonferroni-corrected significance level
                 is known to be conservative, leading to insufficient
                 statistical power when the effect size is moderate at risk
                 locus. Complex structure of linkage disequilibrium also makes
                 it challenging to separate causal variants from nonfunctional
                 ones in large haplotype blocks. Under such circumstances, a
                 computational approach that may increase signal replication
                 rate and identify potential functional sites among correlated
                 markers is urgently needed. RESULTS: We describe GenoWAP, a
                 GWAS signal prioritization method that integrates genomic
                 functional annotation and GWAS test statistics. The
                 effectiveness of GenoWAP is demonstrated through its
                 applications to Crohn's disease and schizophrenia using the
                 largest studies available, where highly ranked loci show
                 substantially stronger signals in the whole dataset after
                 prioritization based on a subset of samples. At the single
                 nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level, top ranked SNPs after
                 prioritization have both higher replication rates and
                 consistently stronger enrichment of eQTLs. Within each risk
                 locus, GenoWAP may be able to distinguish functional sites
                 from groups of correlated SNPs. AVAILABILITY AND
                 IMPLEMENTATION: GenoWAP is freely available on the web at

  abstract =    {Accurate identification of DNA regulatory elements becomes an
                 urgent need in the post-genomic era. Recent genome-wide
                 chromatin states mapping efforts revealed that DNA elements
                 are associated with characteristic chromatin modification
                 signatures, based on which several approaches have been
                 developed to predict transcriptional enhancers. However, their
                 practical application is limited by incomplete extraction of
                 chromatin features and model inconsistency for predicting
                 enhancers across different cell types. To address these
                 issues, we define a set of non-redundant shape features of
                 histone modifications, which shows high consistency across
                 cell types and can greatly reduce the dimensionality of
                 feature vectors. Integrating shape features with a
                 machine-learning algorithm AdaBoost, we developed an enhancer
                 predicting method, DELTA (Distal Enhancer Locating Tool based
                 on AdaBoost). We show that DELTA significantly outperforms
                 current enhancer prediction methods in prediction accuracy on
                 different datasets and can predict enhancers in one cell type
                 using models trained in other cell types without loss of
                 accuracy. Overall, our study presents a novel framework for
                 accurately identifying enhancers from epigenetic data across
                 multiple cell types.},

                 evolution of genes and their function in normal and cancer
                 cells. Deciphering the molecular determinants of this
                 variation will be aided by the elucidation of distinct types
                 of mutations, as they differ in regional preferences and in
                 associations with genomic features. Chromatin organization
                 contributes to regional variation in mutation rates, but its
                 contribution differs among mutation types. In both germline
                 and somatic mutations, base substitutions are more abundant in
                 regions of closed chromatin, perhaps reflecting error
                 accumulation late in replication. By contrast, a distinctive
                 mutational state with very high levels of insertions and
                 deletions (indels) and substitutions is enriched in regions of
                 open chromatin. These associations indicate an intricate
                 interplay between the nucleotide sequence of DNA and its
                 dynamic packaging into chromatin, and have important
                 implications for current biomedical research. This Review
                 focuses on recent studies showing associations between
                 chromatin state and mutation rates, including pairwise and
                 multivariate investigations of germline and somatic

                 body mass index (BMI) and potential interactions between BMI
                 and genetic variants. We applied a joint meta-analysis
                 approach to test associations with fasting insulin and glucose
                 on a genome-wide scale. We present six previously unknown loci
                 associated with fasting insulin at P < 5 \texttimes{} 10(-8)
                 in combined discovery and follow-up analyses of 52 studies
                 comprising up to 96,496 non-diabetic individuals. Risk
                 variants were associated with higher triglyceride and lower
                 high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, suggesting
                 a role for these loci in insulin resistance pathways. The
                 discovery of these loci will aid further characterization of
                 the role of insulin resistance in T2D pathophysiology.},

We show that these variants are concentrated in regulatory DNA marked by deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Eighty-eight percent of such DHSs are active during fetal development and are enriched in variants associated with gestational exposure-related phenotypes. We identified distant gene targets for hundreds of variant-containing DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrated tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. Our results suggest pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease and provide pathogenic insights into diverse disorders.},

  abstract =    {The clinical course of autoimmune and infectious disease
                 varies greatly, even between individuals with the same
                 condition. An understanding of the molecular basis for this
                 heterogeneity could lead to significant improvements in both
                 monitoring and treatment. During chronic infection the process
                 of T-cell exhaustion inhibits the immune response,
                 facilitating viral persistence. Here we show that a
                 transcriptional signature reflecting CD8 T-cell exhaustion is
                 associated with poor clearance of chronic viral infection, but
                 conversely predicts better prognosis in multiple autoimmune
                 diseases. The development of CD8 T-cell exhaustion during
                 chronic infection is driven both by persistence of antigen and
                 by a lack of accessory 'help' signals. In autoimmunity, we
                 find that where evidence of CD4 T-cell co-stimulation is
                 pronounced, that of CD8 T-cell exhaustion is reduced. We can
                 reproduce the exhaustion signature by modifying the balance of
                 persistent stimulation of T-cell antigen receptors and
                 specific CD2-induced co-stimulation provided to human CD8 T
                 cells in vitro, suggesting that each process plays a role in
                 dictating outcome in autoimmune disease. The 'non-exhausted'
                 T-cell state driven by CD2-induced co-stimulation is reduced
                 by signals through the exhaustion-associated inhibitory
                 receptor PD-1, suggesting that induction of exhaustion may be
                 a therapeutic strategy in autoimmune and inflammatory disease.
                 Using expression of optimal surrogate markers of
                 co-stimulation/exhaustion signatures in independent data sets,
                 we confirm an association with good clinical outcome or
                 response to therapy in infection (hepatitis C virus) and
                 vaccination (yellow fever, malaria, influenza), but poor
                 outcome in autoimmune and inflammatory disease (type 1
                 diabetes, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated
                 vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic pulmonary
                 fibrosis and dengue haemorrhagic fever). Thus, T-cell
                 exhaustion plays a central role in determining outcome in
                 autoimmune disease and targeted manipulation of this process
                 could lead to new therapeutic opportunities.},

                 derivative methods such as 4C, 5C and Hi-C have emerged as
                 standard tools to analyze the three-dimensional organization
                 of the genome in the nucleus. These methods employ ligation of
                 diluted cross-linked chromatin complexes, intended to favor
                 proximity-dependent, intra-complex ligation. During
                 development of single-cell Hi-C, we devised an alternative
                 Hi-C protocol with ligation in preserved nuclei rather than in
                 solution. Here we directly compare Hi-C methods employing
                 in-nucleus ligation with the standard in-solution ligation.
                 RESULTS: We show in-nucleus ligation results in consistently
                 lower levels of inter-chromosomal contacts. Through chromatin
                 mixing experiments we show that a significantly large fraction
                 of inter-chromosomal contacts are the result of spurious
                 ligation events formed during in-solution ligation. In-nucleus
                 ligation significantly reduces this source of experimental
                 noise, and results in improved reproducibility between
                 replicates. We also find that in-nucleus ligation eliminates
                 restriction fragment length bias found with in-solution
                 ligation. These improvements result in greater reproducibility
                 of long-range intra-chromosomal and inter-chromosomal
                 contacts, as well as enhanced detection of structural features
                 such as topologically associated domain boundaries.
                 CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in-nucleus ligation captures
                 chromatin interactions more consistently over a wider range of
                 distances, and significantly reduces both experimental noise
                 and bias. In-nucleus ligation creates higher quality Hi-C
                 libraries while simplifying the experimental procedure. We
                 suggest that the entire range of 3C applications are likely to
                 show similar benefits from in-nucleus ligation.},

  abstract =    {A major challenge in human genetics is to devise a systematic
                 strategy to integrate disease-associated variants with diverse
                 genomic and biological data sets to provide insight into
                 disease pathogenesis and guide drug discovery for complex
                 traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we performed a
                 genome-wide association study meta-analysis in a total of
                 >100,000 subjects of European and Asian ancestries (29,880 RA
                 cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating ∼10 million
                 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA
                 risk loci at a genome-wide level of significance, bringing the
                 total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We devised an in silico pipeline
                 using established bioinformatics methods based on functional
                 annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and
                 pathway analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic
                 overlap with human primary immunodeficiency, haematological
                 cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse phenotypes--to
                 identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci.
                 We demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved
                 therapies for RA, and further suggest that drugs approved for
                 other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of RA.
                 Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on
                 fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to
                 RA pathogenesis, and provides empirical evidence that the
                 genetics of RA can provide important information for drug
                 discovery.},

                 susceptibility regions, finding major pathways contributing to
                 risk, with some loci shared across immune disorders. To make
                 genetic comparisons across autoimmune disorders as informative
                 as possible, a dense genotyping array, the Immunochip, was
                 developed, from which we identified four new T1D-associated
                 regions (P < 5 \texttimes{} 10(-8)). A comparative analysis
                 with 15 immune diseases showed that T1D is more similar
                 genetically to other autoantibody-positive diseases,
                 significantly most similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis
                 and significantly least similar to ulcerative colitis, and
                 provided support for three additional new T1D risk loci. Using
                 a Bayesian approach, we defined credible sets for the
                 T1D-associated SNPs. The associated SNPs localized to enhancer
                 sequences active in thymus, T and B cells, and CD34(+) stem
                 cells. Enhancer-promoter interactions can now be analyzed in
                 these cell types to identify which particular genes and
                 regulatory sequences are causal.},

  abstract =    {The adaptive immune system is equipped to eliminate both
                 tumors and pathogenic microorganisms. It requires a series of
                 complex and coordinated signals to drive the activation,
                 proliferation, and differentiation of appropriate T cell
                 subsets. It is now established that changes in cellular
                 activation are coupled to profound changes in cellular
                 metabolism. In addition, emerging evidence now suggest that
                 specific metabolic alterations associated with distinct T cell
                 subsets may be ancillary to their differentiation and
                 influential in their immune functions. The ``Warburg effect''
                 originally used to describe a phenomenon in which most cancer
                 cells relied on aerobic glycolysis for their growth is a key
                 process that sustain T cell activation and differentiation.
                 Here, we review how different aspects of metabolism in T cells
                 influence their functions, focusing on the emerging role of
                 key regulators of glucose metabolism such as HIF-1$\alpha$. A
                 thorough understanding of the role of metabolism in T cell
                 function could provide insights into mechanisms involved in
                 inflammatory-mediated conditions, with the potential for
                 developing novel therapeutic approaches to treat these
                 diseases.},

  abstract =    {MOTIVATION: Imputation using external reference panels (e.g.
                 1000 Genomes) is a widely used approach for increasing power
                 in genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis. Existing
                 hidden Markov models (HMM)-based imputation approaches require
                 individual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method for
                 Gaussian imputation from summary association statistics, a
                 type of data that is becoming widely available. RESULTS: In
                 simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G) data, this method
                 recovers 84\% (54\%) of the effective sample size for common
                 (>5\%) and low-frequency (1-5\%) variants [increasing to 87\%
                 (60\%) when summary linkage disequilibrium information is
                 available from target samples] versus the gold standard of
                 89\% (67\%) for HMM-based imputation, which cannot be applied
                 to summary statistics. Our approach accounts for the limited
                 sample size of the reference panel, a crucial step to
                 eliminate false-positive associations, and it is
                 computationally very fast. As an empirical demonstration, we
                 apply our method to seven case-control phenotypes from the
                 Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and a
                 study of height in the British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC).
                 Gaussian imputation from summary statistics recovers 95\%
                 (105\%) of the effective sample size (as quantified by the
                 ratio of [Formula: see text] association statistics) compared
                 with HMM-based imputation from individual-level genotypes at
                 the 227 (176) published single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
                 in the WTCCC (1958BC height) data. In addition, for publicly
                 available summary statistics from large meta-analyses of four
                 lipid traits, we publicly release imputed summary statistics
                 at 1000G SNPs, which could not have been obtained using
                 previously published methods, and demonstrate their accuracy
                 by masking subsets of the data. We show that 1000G imputation
                 using our approach increases the magnitude and statistical
                 evidence of enrichment at genic versus non-genic loci for
                 these traits, as compared with an analysis without 1000G
                 imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics will be a
                 valuable tool in future functional enrichment analyses.

                 is assumed to have a key role in the regulation of gene
                 expression. In contrast to this generally accepted view, we
                 show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated
                 during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of
                 canonically active histone modifications. Conversely, strong
                 chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and
                 post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also
                 observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which
                 chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of
                 RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene
                 activation and deactivation during development. In the latter
                 case, regulation by transcription factors would have a

  abstract =    {Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can
                 inform genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However,
                 choosing the relevant annotations for interpreting an
                 association study of a given trait remains challenging. I
                 describe a statistical model that uses association statistics
                 computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic
                 elements that are enriched with or depleted of loci
                 influencing a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple
                 types of annotations. I applied the model to GWASs of 18 human
                 traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits,
                 glucose levels, lipid levels, height, body mass index, and
                 Crohn disease. For each trait, I used the model to evaluate
                 the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including
                 protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive
                 sites in over 100 tissues and cell lines. The fraction of
                 phenotype-associated SNPs influencing protein sequence ranged
                 from around 2\% (for platelet volume) up to around 20\% (for
                 low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), repressed chromatin was
                 significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several
                 traits, and cell-type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites
                 were enriched with SNPs associated with several traits (for
                 example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, reweighting
                 each GWAS by using information from functional genomics
                 increased the number of loci with high-confidence associations
                 by around 5\%.},

We find that genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments. We identify ∼10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (>90\%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs "facing" one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats.},

  abstract =    {Immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is elevated
                 in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
                 correlating with disease activity. The established association
                 of IL10 with SLE and other autoimmune diseases led us to fine
                 map causal variant(s) and to explore underlying mechanisms. We
                 assessed 19 tag SNPs, covering the IL10 gene cluster including
                 IL19, IL20 and IL24, for association with SLE in 15,533 case
                 and control subjects from four ancestries. The previously
                 reported IL10 variant, rs3024505 located at 1 kb downstream of
                 IL10, exhibited the strongest association signal and was
                 confirmed for association with SLE in European American (EA)
                 (P = 2.7\texttimes{}{}10⁻⁸, OR = 1.30), but not in non-EA
                 ancestries. SNP imputation conducted in EA dataset identified
                 three additional SLE-associated SNPs tagged by rs3024505
                 (rs3122605, rs3024493 and rs3024495 located at 9.2 kb
                 upstream, intron 3 and 4 of IL10, respectively), and SLE-risk
                 alleles of these SNPs were dose-dependently associated with
                 elevated levels of IL10 mRNA in PBMCs and circulating IL-10
                 protein in SLE patients and controls. Using nuclear extracts
                 of peripheral blood cells from SLE patients for
                 electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified specific
                 binding of transcription factor Elk-1 to oligodeoxynucleotides
                 containing the risk (G) allele of rs3122605, suggesting
                 rs3122605 as the most likely causal variant regulating IL10
                 expression. Elk-1 is known to be activated by phosphorylation
                 and nuclear localization to induce transcription. Of interest,
                 phosphorylated Elk-1 (p-Elk-1) detected only in nuclear
                 extracts of SLE PBMCs appeared to increase with disease
                 activity. Co-expression levels of p-Elk-1 and IL-10 were
                 elevated in SLE T, B cells and monocytes, associated with
                 increased disease activity in SLE B cells, and were best
                 downregulated by ERK inhibitor. Taken together, our data
                 suggest that preferential binding of activated Elk-1 to the
                 IL10 rs3122605-G allele upregulates IL10 expression and
                 confers increased risk for SLE in European Americans.},

                 poised and active enhancer elements marked by histone H3
                 lysine 4 monomethylation and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation,

                 evaluate the role of candidate transcription factors STAT5,
                 FOXP3, RUNX1, and ETS1 in both Treg- and Tconv-specific
                 enhancer architectures. Network analyses of gene expression
                 data revealed additional candidate transcription factors
                 contributing to cell type specificity and a transcription
                 factor network in Tregs that is dominated by FOXP3 interaction
                 partners and targets. In summary, we provide a comprehensive

                 and is hypothesized to impact regulatory elements that
                 modulate gene expression. Here we present a statistically
                 rigorous software tool GREGOR (Genomic Regulatory Elements and
                 Gwas Overlap algoRithm) for evaluating enrichment of any set
                 of genetic variants with any set of regulatory features. Using
                 variants from five phenotypes, we describe a data-driven
                 approach to determine the tissue and cell types most relevant
                 to a trait of interest and to identify the subset of
                 regulatory features likely impacted by these variants. Last,
                 we experimentally evaluate six predicted functional variants
                 at six lipid-associated loci and demonstrate significant
                 evidence for allele-specific impact on expression levels.
                 GREGOR systematically evaluates enrichment of genetic
                 variation with the vast collection of regulatory data
                 available to explore novel biological mechanisms of disease
                 and guide us toward the functional variant at trait-associated

                 enable secure sharing of genomic data from participants in
                 genetic research. Beacons are web servers that answer
                 allele-presence queries-such as ``Do you have a genome that
                 has a specific nucleotide (e.g., A) at a specific genomic
                 position (e.g., position 11,272 on chromosome 1)?''-with
                 either ``yes'' or ``no.'' Here, we show that individuals in a
                 beacon are susceptible to re-identification even if the only
                 data shared include presence or absence information about
                 alleles in a beacon. Specifically, we propose a
                 likelihood-ratio test of whether a given individual is present
                 in a given genetic beacon. Our test is not dependent on allele
                 frequencies and is the most powerful test for a specified
                 false-positive rate. Through simulations, we showed that in a
                 beacon with 1,000 individuals, re-identification is possible
                 with just 5,000 queries. Relatives can also be identified in
                 the beacon. Re-identification is possible even in the presence
                 of sequencing errors and variant-calling differences. In a
                 beacon constructed with 65 European individuals from the 1000
                 Genomes Project, we demonstrated that it is possible to detect
                 membership in the beacon with just 250 SNPs. With just 1,000
                 SNP queries, we were able to detect the presence of an
                 individual genome from the Personal Genome Project in an
                 existing beacon. Our results show that beacons can disclose
                 membership and implied phenotypic information about
                 participants and do not protect privacy a priori. We discuss
                 risk mitigation through policies and standards such as not

  abstract =    {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reproducibly associated variants within introns of FTO with increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the molecular mechanisms linking these noncoding variants with obesity are not immediately obvious, subsequent studies in mice demonstrated that FTO expression levels influence body mass and composition phenotypes. However, no direct connection between the obesity-associated variants and FTO expression or function has been made. Here we show that the obesity-associated noncoding sequences within FTO are functionally connected, at megabase distances, with the homeobox gene IRX3. The obesity-associated FTO region directly interacts with the promoters of IRX3 as well as FTO in the human, mouse and zebrafish genomes. Furthermore, long-range enhancers within this region recapitulate aspects of IRX3 expression, suggesting that the obesity-associated interval belongs to the regulatory landscape of IRX3. Consistent with this, obesity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with expression of IRX3, but not FTO, in human brains. A direct link between IRX3 expression and regulation of body mass and composition is demonstrated by a reduction in body weight of 25 to 30\% in Irx3-deficient mice, primarily through the loss of fat mass and increase in basal metabolic rate with browning of white adipose tissue. Finally, hypothalamic expression of a dominant-negative form of Irx3 reproduces the metabolic phenotypes of Irx3-deficient mice. Our data suggest that IRX3 is a functional long-range target of obesity-associated variants within FTO and represents a novel determinant of body mass and composition.},

  abstract =    {BACKGROUND: Surveillance of integrity of the basic elements of
                 the cell including DNA, RNA, and proteins is a critical
                 element of cellular physiology. Mechanisms of surveillance of
                 DNA and protein integrity are well understood. Surveillance of
                 structural RNAs making up the vast majority of RNA in a cell
                 is less well understood. Here, we sought to explore integrity
                 of processing of structural RNAs in relapsing remitting
                 multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and other inflammatory diseases.
                 RESULTS: We employed mononuclear cells obtained from subjects
                 with RRMS and cell lines. We used quantitative-PCR and whole
                 genome RNA sequencing to define defects in structural RNA
                 surveillance and siRNAs to deplete target proteins. We report
                 profound defects in surveillance of structural RNAs in RRMS
                 exemplified by elevated levels of poly(A) + Y1-RNA, poly(A) +
                 18S rRNA and 28S rRNAs, elevated levels of misprocessed 18S
                 and 28S rRNAs and levels of the U-class of small nuclear RNAs.
                 Multiple sclerosis is also associated with genome-wide defects
                 in mRNA splicing. Ro60 and La proteins, which exist in
                 ribonucleoprotein particles and play different roles in
                 quality control of structural RNAs, are also deficient in
                 RRMS. In cell lines, silencing of the genes encoding Ro60 and
                 La proteins gives rise to these same defects in surveillance
                 of structural RNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish that
                 profound defects in structural RNA surveillance exist in RRMS
                 and establish a causal link between Ro60 and La proteins and
                 integrity of structural RNAs.},

  abstract =    {Genomes contain both a genetic code specifying amino acids and a regulatory code specifying transcription factor (TF) recognition sequences. We used genomic deoxyribonuclease I footprinting to map nucleotide resolution TF occupancy across the human exome in 81 diverse cell types. We found that ~15\% of human codons are dual-use codons ("duons") that simultaneously specify both amino acids and TF recognition sites. Duons are highly conserved and have shaped protein evolution, and TF-imposed constraint appears to be a major driver of codon usage bias. Conversely, the regulatory code has been selectively depleted of TFs that recognize stop codons. More than 17\% of single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter TF binding. Pervasive dual encoding of amino acid and regulatory information appears to be a fundamental feature of genome evolution.},

                 function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate
                 how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data
                 sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where
                 single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two
                 independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA
                 reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is

                 sequence variants, such as loss-of-function and missense
                 variants, are more likely than others to affect protein
                 function and are therefore more likely to be causative. Using

                 for coronary artery disease (CAD) and are targets for
                 therapeutic intervention. We screened the genome for common
                 variants associated with plasma lipids in >100,000 individuals
                 of European ancestry. Here we report 95 significantly

                 significant association with lipid traits for the first time.
                 The newly reported associations include single nucleotide
                 polymorphisms (SNPs) near known lipid regulators (for example,
                 CYP7A1, NPC1L1 and SCARB1) as well as in scores of loci not

                 contribute not only to normal variation in lipid traits but
                 also to extreme lipid phenotypes and have an impact on lipid
                 traits in three non-European populations (East Asians, South

                 genes-GALNT2, PPP1R3B and TTC39B-with experiments in mouse
                 models. Taken together, our findings provide the foundation to

              author; email: gosia.trynka\{at\}gmail.com AbstractIdentifying
              genomic annotations that differentiate causal from associated
              variants is critical to fine-map disease loci. While many studies
              have identified non-coding annotations overlapping disease
              variants, these annotations colocalize, complicating fine-mapping
              efforts. We demonstrate that conventional enrichment tests are
              inflated and cannot distinguish causal effects from colocalizing
              annotations. We developed a sensitive and specific statistical
              approach that is able to identify independent effects from
              colocalizing annotations. We first confirm that gene regulatory
              variants map to DNase-I hypersensitive sites (DHS) near
              transcription start sites. We then show that (1) 15-35\% of
              causal variants within disease loci map to DHS independent of
              other annotations; (2) breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis
              loci harbor potentially causal variants near the summits of
              histone marks rather than full peak bodies; and (3) variants
              associated with height are highly enriched for embryonic stem
              cell DHS sites. We highlight specific loci where we can most
              effectively prioritize causal variation.Received September 17,

  abstract =    {Identifying genomic annotations that differentiate causal from
                 trait-associated variants is essential to fine mapping disease
                 loci. Although many studies have identified non-coding
                 functional annotations that overlap disease-associated
                 variants, these annotations often colocalize, complicating the
                 ability to use these annotations for fine mapping causal
                 variation. We developed a statistical approach (Genomic
                 Annotation Shifter [GoShifter]) to assess whether enriched
                 annotations are able to prioritize causal variation. GoShifter
                 defines the null distribution of an annotation overlapping an
                 allele by locally shifting annotations; this approach is less
                 sensitive to biases arising from local genomic structure than
                 commonly used enrichment methods that depend on SNP matching.
                 Local shifting also allows GoShifter to identify independent
                 causal effects from colocalizing annotations. Using GoShifter,
                 we confirmed that variants in expression quantitative trail
                 loci drive gene-expression changes though DNase-I
                 hypersensitive sites (DHSs) near transcription start sites and
                 independently through 3' UTR regulation. We also showed that
                 (1) 15\%-36\% of trait-associated loci map to DHSs
                 independently of other annotations; (2) loci associated with
                 breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis harbor potentially
                 causal variants near the summits of histone marks rather than
                 full peak bodies; (3) variants associated with height are
                 highly enriched in embryonic stem cell DHSs; and (4) we can
                 effectively prioritize causal variation at specific loci.},

  abstract =    {The move toward precision medicine has highlighted the
                 importance of understanding biological variability within and
                 across individuals in the human population. In particular,
                 given the prevalent involvement of the immune system in
                 diverse pathologies, an important question is how much and
                 what information about the state of the immune system is
                 required to enable accurate prediction of future health and
                 response to medical interventions. Towards addressing this
                 question, recent studies using vaccination as a model
                 perturbation and systems-biology approaches are beginning to
                 provide a glimpse of how natural population variation together
                 with multiplexed, high-throughput measurement and
                 computational analysis can be used to uncover predictors of
                 immune response quality in humans. Here I discuss recent
                 developments in this emerging field, with emphasis on baseline
                 correlates of vaccination responses, sources of immune-state
                 variability, as well as relevant features of study design,
                 data generation, and computational analysis.},

                 contributing to cognitive impairment, growth retardation and
                 impaired physical capacity. To understand further the genetic
                 factors influencing red blood cells, we carried out a
                 genome-wide association study of haemoglobin concentration and
                 related parameters in up to 135,367 individuals. Here we
                 identify 75 independent genetic loci associated with one or
                 more red blood cell phenotypes at P < 10(-8), which together
                 explain 4-9\% of the phenotypic variance per trait. Using
                 expression quantitative trait loci and bioinformatic
                 strategies, we identify 121 candidate genes enriched in
                 functions relevant to red blood cell biology. The candidate
                 genes are expressed preferentially in red blood cell
                 precursors, and 43 have haematopoietic phenotypes in Mus
                 musculus or Drosophila melanogaster. Through open-chromatin
                 and coding-variant analyses we identify potential causal
                 genetic variants at 41 loci. Our findings provide extensive
                 new insights into genetic mechanisms and biological pathways

  abstract =    {The RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway is essential for
                 detecting cytosolic viral RNA to trigger the production of
                 type I interferons (IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$) that initiate an
                 innate antiviral response. Through systematic assessment of a
                 wide variety of genomics data, we discovered 10 molecular
                 signatures of known RLR pathway components that collectively
                 predict novel members. We demonstrate that RLR pathway genes,
                 among others, tend to evolve rapidly, interact with viral
                 proteins, contain a limited set of protein domains, are
                 regulated by specific transcription factors, and form a
                 tightly connected interaction network. Using a Bayesian
                 approach to integrate these signatures, we propose likely
                 novel RLR regulators. RNAi knockdown experiments revealed a
                 high prediction accuracy, identifying 94 genes among 187
                 candidates tested (~50\%) that affected viral RNA-induced
                 production of IFN$\beta$. The discovered antiviral regulators
                 may participate in a wide range of processes that highlight
                 the complexity of antiviral defense (e.g. MAP3K11, CDK11B,
                 PSMA3, TRIM14, HSPA9B, CDC37, NUP98, G3BP1), and include

                 the association between one phenotype and a large number of
                 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are limited in two
                 ways: (i) traits are often multivariate, and analysis of
                 composite scores entails loss in statistical power and (ii)
                 gene-based analyses may be preferred, e.g. to decrease the
                 multiple testing problem. RESULTS: Here we present a new
                 method, multivariate gene-based association test by extended
                 Simes procedure (MGAS), that allows gene-based testing of
                 multivariate phenotypes in unrelated individuals. Through
                 extensive simulation, we show that under most trait-generating
                 genotype-phenotype models MGAS has superior statistical power
                 to detect associated genes compared with gene-based analyses
                 of univariate phenotypic composite scores (i.e. GATES,
                 multiple regression), and multivariate analysis of variance
                 (MANOVA). Re-analysis of metabolic data revealed 32 False
                 Discovery Rate controlled genome-wide significant genes, and
                 12 regions harboring multiple genes; of these 44 regions, 30
                 were not reported in the original analysis. CONCLUSION: MGAS
                 allows researchers to conduct their multivariate gene-based
                 analyses efficiently, and without the loss of power that is
                 often associated with an incorrectly specified
                 genotype-phenotype models. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

              C-type lectins are key players in immune regulation by driving
              distinct functions of antigen-presenting cells. The C-type lectin
              CLEC16A gene is located at 16p13, a susceptibility locus for
              several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis.
              However, the function of this gene and its potential contribution
              to these diseases in humans are poorly understood. In this study,
              we found a strong upregulation of CLEC16A expression in the white
              matter of multiple sclerosis patients (n = 14) compared to
              non-demented controls (n = 11), mainly in perivascular leukocyte
              infiltrates. Moreover, CLEC16A levels were significantly enhanced
              in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of multiple sclerosis
              patients (n = 69) versus healthy controls (n = 46). In peripheral
              blood mononuclear cells, CLEC16A was most abundant in
              monocyte-derived dendritic cells, in which it strongly
              co-localized with human leukocyte antigen class II. Treatment of
              these professional antigen-presenting cells with vitamin D, a key
              protective environmental factor in multiple sclerosis,
              downmodulated CLEC16A in parallel with human leukocyte antigen
              class II. Knockdown of CLEC16A in distinct types of model and
              primary antigen-presenting cells resulted in severely impaired
              cytoplasmic distribution and formation of human leucocyte antigen
              class II-positive late endosomes, as determined by
              immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Mechanistically,
              CLEC16A participated in the molecular machinery of human
              leukocyte antigen class II-positive late endosome formation and
              trafficking to perinuclear regions, involving the dynein motor
              complex. By performing co-immunoprecipitations, we found that
              CLEC16A directly binds to two critical members of this complex,
              RILP and the HOPS complex. CLEC16A silencing in
              antigen-presenting cells disturbed RILP-mediated recruitment of
              human leukocyte antigen class II-positive late endosomes to
              perinuclear regions. Together, we identify CLEC16A as a pivotal
              gene in multiple sclerosis that serves as a direct regulator of
              the human leukocyte antigen class II pathway in
              antigen-presenting cells. These findings are a first step in
              coupling multiple sclerosis-associated genes to the regulation of
              the strongest genetic factor in multiple sclerosis, human
              leukocyte antigen class II. C-type lectinhuman leukocyte

  abstract =    {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common and severe
                 chronic diseases affecting both children and adults. The
                 etiology of the disease remains unknown and thus far, no
                 ``true'' cure for those affected is available. Indeed,
                 exogenous insulin replacement therapy to manage glucose
                 metabolism to the best degree possible, remains the current
                 standard of care. However, despite a recent array of truly
                 impressive improvements designed to enhance disease management
                 (e.g., insulin analogues, continuous glucose monitoring,
                 insulin pumps), it is still difficult for the vast majority of
                 patients to reach recommended target HbA1C levels (<7.0\%). As
                 a result of sub-optimal disease management, far too many
                 patients with T1D have an increased risk for
                 disease-associated complications such as nephropathy,
                 neuropathy, and retinopathy, as well as hypoglycemia. New
                 treatment modalities are therefore urgently needed to bring a
                 ``true'' cure (disease prevention/disease reversal) to
                 patients with T1D. Here we consider issues that collectively
                 pose a major stumbling block in T1D research with respect to
                 identifying a means to prevent and/or cure the disease. We
                 begin this Perspective by discussing new insights emanating
                 from studies of the pancreas in human T1D; findings which may,
                 at least in part, explain why previous interventions seeking
                 disease prevention/reversal have yielded insufficient benefit.
                 We then turn to suggestions that could optimize the outcome of
                 future clinical trials. Finally, we direct attention to
                 recommendations for the global T1D research community;
                 messages we deem to have the potential to improve our chances
                 of finding the elusive T1D ``cure.'' This article is protected

We describe an approximate Bayes factor that is straightforward to use and is appropriate when sample sizes are large. We consider various choices of the prior on the effect size, including those that allow effect size to vary with the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the marker. An important contribution is the description of a specific prior that gives identical rankings between Bayes factors and P-values, providing a link between the two approaches, and allowing the implications of the use of P-values to be more easily understood. As a summary measure of noteworthiness P-values are difficult to calibrate since their interpretation depends on MAF and, crucially, on sample size. A consequence is that a consistent decision-making procedure using P-values requires a threshold for significance that reduces with sample size, contrary to common practice.},

  abstract =    {Identification of candidate causal variants in regions associated with risk of common diseases is complicated by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and multiple association signals. Nonetheless, accurate maps of these variants are needed, both to fully exploit detailed cell specific chromatin annotation data to highlight disease causal mechanisms and cells, and for design of the functional studies that will ultimately be required to confirm causal mechanisms. We adapted a Bayesian evolutionary stochastic search algorithm to the fine mapping problem, and demonstrated its improved performance over conventional stepwise and regularised regression through simulation studies. We then applied it to fine map the established multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) associations in the IL-2RA (CD25) gene region. For T1D, both stepwise and stochastic search approaches identified four T1D association signals, with the major effect tagged by the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12722496. In contrast, for MS, the stochastic search found two distinct competing models: a single candidate causal variant, tagged by rs2104286 and reported previously using stepwise analysis; and a more complex model with two association signals, one of which was tagged by the major T1D associated rs12722496 and the other by rs56382813. There is low to moderate LD between rs2104286 and both rs12722496 and rs56382813 (r2 ≃ 0:3) and our two SNP model could not be recovered through a forward stepwise search after conditioning on rs2104286. Both signals in the two variant model for MS affect CD25 expression on distinct subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, which are key cells in the autoimmune process. The results support a shared causal variant for T1D and MS. Our study illustrates the benefit of using a purposely designed model search strategy for fine mapping and the advantage of combining disease and protein expression data.},

Here, we profiled several histone modifications, the transcription factor (TF) PU.1, RNA polymerase II, and gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 47 whole-genome sequenced individuals. We observed that distinct cis-regulatory elements exhibit coordinated chromatin variation across individuals in the form of variable chromatin modules (VCMs) at sub-Mb scale. VCMs were associated with thousands of genes and preferentially cluster within chromosomal contact domains. We mapped strong proximal and weak, yet more ubiquitous, distal-acting chromatin quantitative trait loci (cQTL) that frequently explain this variation. cQTLs were associated with molecular activity at clusters of cis-regulatory elements and mapped preferentially within TF-bound regions. We propose that local, sequence-independent chromatin variation emerges as a result of genetic perturbations in cooperative interactions between cis-regulatory elements that are located within the same genomic domain.},

  abstract = {Identifying the gene targets of distal regulatory sequences is a
              challenging problem with the potential to illuminate the causal
              underpinnings of complex diseases. However, current experimental
              methods to map enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide are
              limited by their cost and complexity. We present TargetFinder, a
              computational method that reconstructs a cell's three-dimensional
              regulatory landscape from two-dimensional genomic features.
              TargetFinder achieves outstanding predictive accuracy across
              diverse cell lines with a false discovery rate up to fifteen
              times smaller than common heuristics, and reveals that distal
              regulatory interactions are characterized by distinct signatures
              of protein interactions and epigenetic marks on the DNA loop
              between an active enhancer and targeted promoter. Much of this
              signature is shared across cell types, shedding light on the role

  abstract =    {MOTIVATION: The protein-DNA interactions between transcription
                 factors (TFs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs,
                 also known as DNA motifs) are critical activities in gene
                 transcription. The identification of the DNA motifs is a vital
                 task for downstream analysis. Unfortunately, the long-range
                 coupling information between different DNA motifs is still
                 lacking. To fill the void, as the first-of-its-kind study, we
                 have identified the coupling DNA motif pairs on long-range
                 chromatin interactions in human. RESULTS: The coupling DNA
                 motif pairs exhibit substantially higher DNase accessibility
                 than the background sequences. Half of the DNA motifs involved
                 are matched to the existing motif databases, although nearly
                 all of them are enriched with at least one gene ontology term.
                 Their motif instances are also found statistically enriched on
                 the promoter and enhancer regions. Especially, we introduce a
                 novel measurement called motif pairing multiplicity which is
                 defined as the number of motifs that are paired with a given
                 motif on chromatin interactions. Interestingly, we observe
                 that motif pairing multiplicity is linked to several
                 characteristics such as regulatory region type, motif sequence
                 degeneracy, DNase accessibility and pairing genomic distance.
                 Taken into account together, we believe the coupling DNA motif
                 pairs identified in this study can shed lights on the gene
                 transcription mechanism under long-range chromatin
                 interactions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The identified
                 motif pair data is compressed and available in the
                 supplementary materials associated with this manuscript.

  abstract =    {Using genome-wide data from 253,288 individuals, we identified
                 697 variants at genome-wide significance that together
                 explained one-fifth of the heritability for adult height. By
                 testing different numbers of variants in independent studies,
                 we show that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and
                 ∼9,500 SNPs explained ∼21\%, ∼24\% and ∼29\% of phenotypic
                 variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured
                 60\% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci
                 were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be
                 involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways
                 not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by
                 fibroblast growth factors, WNT/$\beta$-catenin and chondroitin
                 sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and
                 pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth,
                 including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid.
                 Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height
                 that is characterized by a very large but finite number
                 (thousands) of causal variants.},

  abstract =    {Initial results from sequencing studies suggest that there are
                 relatively few low-frequency (<5\%) variants associated with
                 large effects on common phenotypes. We performed low-pass
                 whole-genome sequencing in 680 individuals from the InCHIANTI
                 study to test two primary hypotheses: (i) that sequencing
                 would detect single low-frequency-large effect variants that
                 explained similar amounts of phenotypic variance as single
                 common variants, and (ii) that some common variant
                 associations could be explained by low-frequency variants. We
                 tested two sets of disease-related common phenotypes for which
                 we had statistical power to detect large numbers of common
                 variant-common phenotype associations-11 132 cis-gene
                 expression traits in 450 individuals and 93 circulating
                 biomarkers in all 680 individuals. From a total of 11 657 229
                 high-quality variants of which 6 129 221 and 5 528 008 were
                 common and low frequency (<5\%), respectively, low
                 frequency-large effect associations comprised 7\% of
                 detectable cis-gene expression traits [89 of 1314 cis-eQTLs at
                 P < 1 \texttimes{} 10(-06) (false discovery rate ∼5\%)] and
                 one of eight biomarker associations at P < 8 \texttimes{}
                 10(-10). Very few (30 of 1232; 2\%) common variant
                 associations were fully explained by low-frequency variants.
                 Our data show that whole-genome sequencing can identify
                 low-frequency variants undetected by genotyping based
                 approaches when sample sizes are sufficiently large to detect
                 substantial numbers of common variant associations, and that
                 common variant associations are rarely explained by single
                 low-frequency variants of large effect.},

                 the mechanisms involved. Here, we demonstrate that an
                 N-terminal proline-rich interaction region is crucial for
                 Foxp3's function. Subdomains within this key region link Foxp3
                 to several independent mechanisms of transcriptional
                 regulation. Our study suggests that Foxp3, even in the absence
                 of its DNA-binding forkhead domain, acts as a bridge between
                 DNA-binding interaction partners and proteins with effector
                 function permitting it to regulate a large number of genes. We
                 show that, in one such mechanism, Foxp3 recruits class I
                 histone deacetylases to the promoters of target genes,
                 counteracting activation-induced histone acetylation and
                 thereby suppressing their expression.},

  journal =  {Bioinformatics},
  year =     {2015},
  month =    {24~} # mar,
  abstract = {Background: Imputation of individual level genotypes at untyped
              markers using an external reference panel of genotyped or
              sequenced individuals has become standard practice in genetic
              association studies. Direct imputation of summary statistics can
              also be valuable, for example in meta-analyses where individual
              level genotype data are not available. Two methods (DIST and
              ImpG-Summary/LD), that assume a multivariate Gaussian
              distribution for the association summary statistics, have been
              proposed for imputing association summary statistics. However,
              both methods assume that the correlations between association
              summary statistics are the same as the correlations between the
              corresponding genotypes. This assumption can be violated in the
              presence of confounding covariates. Methods: We analytically show
              that in the absence of covariates, correlation among association
              summary statistics is indeed the same as that among the
              corresponding genotypes, thus serving as a theoretical
              justification for the recently-proposed methods. We continue to
              prove that in the presence of covariates, correlation among
              association summary statistics becomes the partial correlation of
              the corresponding genotypes controlling for covariates. We
              therefore develop DISSCO, direct imputation of summary statistics
              allowing covariates. Results: We consider two real-life scenarios
              where the correlation and partial correlation likely make
              practical difference: (1) association studies in admixed
              populations; (2) association studies in presence of other
              confounding covariate(s). Application of DISSCO to real datasets
              under both scenarios shows at least comparable, if not better,
              performance compared to existing correlation-based methods,
              particularly for lower frequency variants. For example, DISSCO
              can reduce the absolute deviation from the truth by 3.9-15.2\%
              for variants with minor allele frequency below 5\%.Software

              8900 genetic variants, mainly single-nucleotide polymorphisms
              (SNPs), associated with hundreds of human traits and diseases,
              which define risk-associated loci. Variants that map to coding
              regions can affect protein sequence, translation rate, and
              alternative splicing, all of which influence protein function.
              However, the vast majority of sequence variants map to non-coding
              intergenic and intronic regions, and it has been much more
              challenging to assess the functional nature of these variants.
              Recent work annotating the non-coding regions of the genome has
              contributed to post-GWAS studies by facilitating the
              identification of the functional targets of risk-associated loci.
              Many non-coding genetic variants within risk-associated loci
              alter gene expression by modulating the activity of
              cis-regulatory elements. We review here these recent findings,
              discuss their implication for the post-GWAS era, and relate their
              importance to the interpretation of disease-associated mutations
              identified through whole-genome sequencing.},

                 unique genes. Many sQTL-associated genes (40\%) undergo
                 alternative splicing. Using the National Human Genome Research
                 Institute (NHGRI) genome-wide association study (GWAS)
                 catalog, we determined that 528 unique sQTLs were
                 significantly enriched for 8,845 SNPs associated with traits
                 in previous GWAS. In particular, we found 395 (4.5\%) GWAS
                 SNPs with evidence of cis sQTLs but not gene-level cis
                 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), suggesting that
                 sQTL analysis could provide additional insights into the
                 functional mechanism underlying GWAS results. Our findings
                 provide an informative sQTL resource for further
                 characterizing the potential functional roles of SNPs that
                 control transcript isoforms relevant to common diseases.},

  abstract =    {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with human complex traits. However, the genes or functional DNA elements through which these variants exert their effects on the traits are often unknown. We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation.},
